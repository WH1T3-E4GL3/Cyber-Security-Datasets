## Network Traffic

- [ISCX VPN-nonVPN Traffic Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html) - This dataset contains VPN and non-VPN traffic from 2019. It contains 2.6 million records of VPN traffic and 2.4 million records of non-VPN traffic. The dataset is collected by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) at the University of New Brunswick.
- [Unified Host and Network Dataset](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/2017.html) - The Unified Host and Network Dataset is a subset of network and computer (host) events collected from the Los Alamos National Laboratory enterprise network over the course of approximately 90 days. The host event logs originated from most enterprise computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system on Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) enterprise network. The network event data originated from many of the internal enterprise routers within the LANL enterprise network.
- [Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/) - This data set represents 58 consecutive days of de-identified event data collected from five sources within Los Alamos National Laboratory's corporate, internal computer network.
- [User-Computer Authentication Associations in Time](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/auth/) - This anonymized data set encompasses 9 continuous months and represents 708,304,516 successful authentication events from users to computers collected from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) enterprise network.
- [Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity datasets](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html) - Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity datasets are used around the world by universities, private industry and independent researchers.
- [KDD Cup 1999 Data]() - This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.
- [2017-SUEE-data-set](https://github.com/vs-uulm/2017-SUEE-data-set) - The data sets contain traffic in and out of the web server of the Student Union for Electrical Engineering (Fachbereichsvertretung Elektrotechnik) at Ulm University. Internal hosts are hosts from within the university network, some of them are cable bound, others connect through one of two wifi services on campus (eduroam and welcome). The data was mixed with attack traffic.
- [CTU-13 Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13/) - A Labeled Dataset with Botnet, Normal and Background traffic.
- [PCAP files](https://www.netresec.com/index.ashx?page=PcapFiles) - Malware Traffic, Network Forensics, SCADA/ICS Network Captures, Packet Injection Attacks / Man-on-the-Side Attacksâ€¦
- [PCAPT](https://github.com/windy/pcapr) - Big repository of PCAP files.
- [Project Sonar](https://github.com/rapid7/sonar/wiki/UDP) - Project Sonar produces multiple UDP datasets every month. This data is gathered by sending protocol-specific UDP probes across the entire IPv4 address space. The types of probes sent each week continues to expand as the project matures.
- [IoT Devices Captures](https://research.aalto.fi/en/datasets/iot-devices-captures(285a9b06-de31-4d8b-88e9-5bdba46cc161).html) - This dataset represents the traffic emitted during the setup of 31 smart home IoT devices of 27 different types (4 types are represented by 2 devices each). Each setup was repeated at least 20 times per device-type.

## Malware

- [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) - MalwareBazaar is a project from abuse.ch with the goal of sharing malware samples with the infosec community, AV vendors and threat intelligence providers.
- [UNSW-NB15 data set](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/) - This data set has nine families of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus, Bro-IDS tools are utilised and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label.
- [Malware Training Sets](https://marcoramilli.blogspot.com/2016/12/malware-training-sets-machine-learning.html) - Today (please refers to blog post date) the collected classified datasets is composed by the following samples: APT1 292 Samples, Crypto 2024 Samples, Locker 434 Samples, Zeus 2014 Samples.
- [The Drebin Dataset](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/) - The dataset contains 5,560 applications from 179 different malware families. The samples have been collected in the period of August 2010 to October 2012 and were made available to us by the MobileSandbox project.
- [Stratosphere IPS](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-overview/) - Malware captures, Normal captures, mixed captures.
- [Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data) - You are provided with a set of known malware files representing a mix of 9 different families. Each malware file has an Id, a 20 character hash value uniquely identifying the file, and a Class, an integer representing one of 9 family names.

## Software

- [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) - Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open source automated malware analysis system.
- [Javascript Vulnerability dataset](http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~ferenc/papers/JSVulnerabilityDataSet/) - Dataset constructed from the vulnerability information in public databases of the Node Security Project and the Snyk platform, and code fixing patches from GitHub.
